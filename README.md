In this project, you will build a very simple web server that will only respond to a basic request for http://localhost:8080/.

Your server should also log each request to the console (on the server-side). As the "webmaster" you will then be able to see all the visits your site generates.

As is customary when learning a new technology: your first server will respond with "Hello World".
